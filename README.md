# Tracking disinfection cart

## - DESIGN DESCRIPTION - 

This design is the first time I participated in a science and technology innovation competition during my sophomore year in college. At that time, the design was still very immature, but it had great commemorative significance.

The purpose of this design is to create a visually controlled patrol and disinfection car based on the McNam wheel. The car will work continuously along the wiring trajectory and will stop for disinfection when it encounters a target that needs to be disinfected.
